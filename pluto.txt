It is so a planet!

Here's some information about Pluto(by Eliam):
    Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, 
    a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first and the largest Kuiper
    belt object to be discovered. After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to 
    be the ninth planet from the Sun.
